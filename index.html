        <p>When eve falls, will you know what to do? When the night engulfs all hope, how can you know you're doing the right thing?</p>
        <p>In a world full of mistakes, do your choices matter? When everything is concluded, your results will show the truth.</p>
        <p>Mistakes. Regrets. Worries. Have you done enough? Will you have to try again? When failure is an option, what counts as success?</p>
        <p>Your actions, they matter to somebody.</p>
        <p>But who?</p>
