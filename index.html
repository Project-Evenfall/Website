            When eve falls, will you know what to do? When the night engulfs all hope, how can you know you're doing the right thing?
        </p>

        <p>
            In a world full of mistakes, do your choices matter? When everything is concluded, your results will show the truth.
        </p>

        <p>
            Mistakes. Regrets. Worries. Have you done enough? Will you have to try again? When failure is an option, what counts as success?
        </p>

        <p>
            Your actions, they matter to somebody.
        </p>

        <p>
            But who?
